## About Me
An aspiring Full Stack C# Developer that is very passionate about learning new technologies. Coming from a diverse background of part time jobs instilled the realization to pursue a focused career in Software Development. Driven and diligent to tackle and complete the task(s) at hand. Interested in pursuing an opportunity that will provide experience for the next steps to progress my career. Intent on achieving this by working with other team members, solving challenging problems, contributing to the team and continually learning from this environment.


## Projects
**Relativity Capstone Project**  // *Solo Project*

An application that pulls data from the Open Weather API and a CSV file of airports around the world to calculate the weather, including wind direction, in the area around the airport that is queried. The call to the weather API returns a 2 week forecast of the airport that was searched. There is also a list of airports that is paginated and made more efficient by caching the API calls.  

C#, React.js and Azure SQL DB


**TaskLog** // *Solo Project*

This  project was started after Coding Dojo. It is a Project Tracking App with the ability to add and check off projects. Users can give each project an estimated duration time it will take to complete and set a date that the project is expected to be finished. Each project can have tasks and subtasks. Edit functionality for the Projects, tasks, and subtasks is available as needed. Time spent versus time expected is calculated and available to compare how long you expected it would take you.

C#, ASP.NET Core, and Azure SQL DB


**Scrambler** // *Lead Backend and Frontend Developer*

iOS App that grabs a word from a JSON file and scrambles it into tiles then renders it. The user then tries to guess the word. Designed and implemented the Frontend using Photoshop CS6 and Unity. Also designed the scrambling feature of the word and validation each time the word is changed. Alerts the user that the word is incorrect and resets itself with the same word.

C#, Xcode, Unity Game Engine, and Photoshop CS6


## Work Experience

Was able to learn from shadowing my coworkers and taking notes on what they were doing.
